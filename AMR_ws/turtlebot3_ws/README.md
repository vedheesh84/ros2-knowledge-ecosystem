# turtlebot3_ws

**Level 1 Capstone Robot Workspace & Autonomous Mobile Robotics Platform**

An industry-standard differential-drive mobile robotics platform integrating hardware abstraction, physics simulation, action servers, multi-robot namespacing, SLAM mapping, and Nav2 autonomous navigation.

---

## 1. Overview & Identity

`turtlebot3_ws` serves as the **Level 1 Capstone Proving Ground** for the ROS2 curriculum. It provides a complete, working cyber-physical embodiment of all concepts taught across Articles 1–25 (Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions, Parameters, Launch Design, Namespacing, Lifecycle, TF Trees, Simulation, Debugging, and Systems Thinking).

Furthermore, it acts as the foundational bridge and gateway to specialized Autonomous Mobile Robotics (AMR), Cartographer 2D SLAM, and Navigation2 (Nav2) stacks.

## 5. Capstone Demonstration Progression

To explore all 25 curriculum concepts running inside this embodied mobile robot, follow the comprehensive [CAPSTONE_DEMONSTRATION_GUIDE.md](CAPSTONE_DEMONSTRATION_GUIDE.md):

1. **Stage 1 (Kinematic Testing)**: Lightweight testing via `turtlebot3_fake_node` (no physics engine required).
2. **Stage 2 (Physics Simulation)**: Full Gazebo world bringup with laser scanners, contact physics, and camera feeds.
3. **Stage 3 (ROS2 Actions in Action)**: Run `/patrol` Action Server and send square-patrol goals with real-time feedback.
4. **Stage 4 (Multi-Robot Namespaces & Scaling)**: Spawn isolated multi-robot instances (`tb3_0`, `tb3_1`) using `multi_robot.launch.py`.
5. **Stage 5 (Safety & Introspection)**: Intercept `/cmd_vel` with `turtlebot3_obstacle_detection` to prevent collisions.
6. **Stage 6 (AMR Gateway — SLAM & Nav2)**: 2D Cartographer mapping and autonomous waypoint navigation.
